\section{Introduction}

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Juno mission has now been orbiting Jupiter for nearly three years, at the time of this writing.
Since arrival, Juno has arguably uncovered more questions than it has answered, although its discoveries are nothing short of amazing.
In its time spent at Jupiter, it has put greater constraints on gravitational field, measured a much more intense magnetic field than predicted, and observed particle species in the magnetosphere that still bring about confusion.
Most importantly to this paper, Juno has been able to measure heavy ions above the polar caps that indicate they are precipitating into the top of the atmosphere \citep{haggerty2017}.

X-ray production at Jupiter has been of interest to the space physics community from when it was first observed by the Einstein Observatory in April of 1979 \citep{metzger1983}.
Although \citet{metzger1983} were unable to distinguish a line spectrum from a continuum due to the limitations of the detector, they still proposed that the source of X-rays must be coming from heavy ion precipitation, stating, ``the shape of the response and the observed X-ray power indicate that the source of this auroral emission is not electron bremmstrahlung as on the earth, but is most probably line emission from O and S ions with energies between 0.03 and 4.0 MeV/nucleon...''
Now, with the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, oxygen and sulfur ions have been measured above the polar caps with energies up to 400 keV per nucleon (u) \citep{haggerty2017,clark2017a,clark2017b}.

In the past, there have been attempts to reproduce the X-ray emission observed at Jupiter with ion precipitation models \citep{cravens1995,ozak2010,ozak2013}, but they mostly fell short due to the high energy ($>$1.2 MeV/u) required to strip the ions of their electrons enough to produce X-rays.
Although the energies proposed even seemed high at the time, this could be overlooked because there were not any in situ measurements of the ion energies above the polar cap.
However, now with more accurate ion-neutral collision cross-sections from \citet{schultz2018} that include processes never before considered, we will show that the necessary ion energy needs to only be about 200 keV/u to begin producing X-rays.

We have expanded on the ion precipitation models that have come before \citep{cravens1995,ozak2010,ozak2013,houston2018}, modeling oxygen from 10 keV/u to 25 MeV/u, including the O$^-$ charge state through O$^{8+}$.
For sulfur we will show results between 10 keV/u and 2 MeV/u for S neutral through S$^{16+}$.

Throughout this paper, following historical nomenclature, we will refer to the precipitating particle (either oxygen or sulfur) as an ion and the target particle (molecular hydrogen) as the atom, although the target particles often end up ionized and the precipitating particles can, and will, reach a neutral state.

\section{Physical Processes and Model Description}

The model presented in this manuscript is introduced in great detail by \citet{houston2018}, \citet{ozak2010}, \citet{ozak2013}, and the references therein.
\citet{houston2018} primarily focused on field-aligned currents (FAC) and ultraviolet (UV) emission from oxygen, \citet{ozak2010} showed X-ray production rates from precipitating oxygen and sulfur, and \citet{ozak2013} made predictions of FAC and airglow intensities that Juno would measure when it arrived to Jupiter.
We follow up on the promise of \citet{houston2018} to include energetic sulfur precipitation and oxygen improvements; however, proton precipitation will be left to a future publication. 

Here, we present X-ray productions from precipitating oxygen and sulfur, rather than FAC and UV emission.
We layout the differences and updates to the simulation, but the finer details of the model will be left to the previous papers.
Aside from optimization improvements, the main contrast can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Jovian atmosphere has been extended deeper, down below the 1 bar level.
\item Oxygen cross-sections previously only included non-simultaneous (NSIM) collisions; we now consider simultaneous (SIM) ion-target interactions.
\item Sulfur SIM cross-sections have been analyzed and are included in the model.
\item X-ray efficiencies and synthetic X-ray spectra that include opacity effects are presented with both the current atmosphere and an upper limit, fully mixed atmosphere.
\item Juno data (both oxygen and sulfur measurements) are adapted and input into the simulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Jovian Atmosphere}
\label{sec:atm}

\citet{houston2018} used a neutral atmosphere originally presented by \citet{maurellis2001} based on Galileo probe data \citep{seiff1996,seiff1997} and remote observations \citep{sada1998}.
The same atmosphere is used here, only we have extended the depth from 200 km to -88 km, where 0 km is set to where the pressure is equal to 1 bar (Fig. \ref{fig:atm}).
The deeper atmosphere has been generated using temperature-pressure profiles retrieved from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph Instrument (IRTF-TEXES) \citep{sinclair2018} and the ideal gas law because the measurements come from below the homopause, where the atmosphere is well-mixed.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Atmosphere.eps}
\caption{Atmospheric density profiles of H$_{2}$, He, CH$_{4}$, and H based on data shown in \citet{maurellis2001} and \citet{sinclair2018}. Also shown is the neutral temperature profile as a function of altitude and pressure.}
\label{fig:atm}
\end{figure}

When opacity effects are discussed, the second atmosphere investigated is generated by taking the mixing ratio of molecular hydrogen to helium and methane at the bottom of the density profile in Figure \ref{fig:atm} and then redistributing helium and methane from the top of the atmosphere with that same mixing ratio.
The H$_{2}$ distribution remains the same, thus ion precipitation will not be effected because only ion collisions in a hydrogen gas are considered.
Atomic hydrogen is ignored in the well-mixed atmosphere because of how chemically active it tends to be (as can be seen in the original atmosphere, below the homopause) and it is not unreasonable to think the column density of H will have negligible affects on the opacity of X-ray emission, as it does in the original atmosphere.
We will refer to the atmosphere displayed in Figure \ref{fig:atm} as atmosphere 1 and the well-mixed atmosphere as atmosphere 2.

\subsection{Ion-Neutral Impact Processes}

\citet{houston2018} modeled oxygen precipitation using 9 different collision processes that occurred non-simultaneously as the ion precipitated through the atmosphere following the cross-section data presented by \citet{schultz2017} and summarized here:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
O^{q+} + H_{2} \rightarrow \begin{cases}
O^{q+} + H_{2}^{+} + e & \text{Single Ionization} \\
O^{q+} + 2H^{+} + 2e & \text{Double Ionization}
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:ion}
\end{equation}
\vspace*{-0.5cm}
\begin{equation}
O^{q+} + H_{2} \rightarrow \begin{cases}
O^{(q-1)+}
\begin{cases}
H_{2}^{+} &  \text{Single Capture} \\
H^{+} + H^{+} + e &   \text{Transfer Ionization} \\
\end{cases} \\
\\
O^{(q-2)+}
\begin{cases}
2H^{+} \rightarrow O^{(q-1)+} + e & \text{Double Capture -- Autoionization} \\
H^{+} + H^{+} & \text{Double Capture} \\
\end{cases}
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:cap}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
O^{q+} + H_{2} \rightarrow \begin{cases}
O^{(q+1)} + H_{2}^{+} + 2e; H + H^{+} + 2e & \text{Single Stripping} \\
O^{(q+2)} + H_{2}^{+} + 3e; H + H^{+} + 3e & \text{Double Stripping} 
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:strip}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
O^{q+} + H_{2} \rightarrow
O^{q+} + H_{2}^{*}; H^{*} + H^{*} \hspace{.1in} \text{Electronic Excitation - All States}
\label{eqn:ex}
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:all}
\end{subequations}

However, since then, \citet{schultz2018} has proposed that target and projectile processes could occur simultaneously (referred to as SIM collisions) and the cross-sections should reflected this, ultimately providing the cross-sections for 35 processes that are used in the current model.
The NSIM and SIM projectile and target processes used are the following:

\end{tabbing}
where X stands for the projectile, either O or S. $q$ is the charge state and depends on the number of electrons bound to the ion; $q$ runs from 0 to 8 for O and from 0 to 16 for S.
Some processes are not possible for neutral or singly ionized atoms or, similarly, for fully stripped or O$^{7+}$ and S$^{15+}$ ions (e.g., for neutral O and S, SC and DC are not possible, or for O$^{8+}$ and S$^{16+}$, SS and DS are not considered).

The explicit calculation and implication of using SIM cross-sections rather than NSIM cross-sections can be found in \citet{schultz2018}; but for the model presented, it has shifted the peaks of the charge state equilibrium fractions down to a lower initial ion energy, ultimately requiring less energy to fully strip both oxygen and sulfur ions.

\subsection{Charge State Equilibrium Fractions}

In a very broad sense, as an ion precipitates through the atmosphere each collision can result in four different outcomes for the projectile.
The ion can become excited (e.g. SPEX), become further ionized by losing an electron or two (e.g. DS), become less ionized by gaining an electron or two (e.g. DCAI), or nothing can happen to it while the collision solely affects the target (e.g. SI).
Each type of interaction is governed by the energy of the precipitating ion; that is, a more energetic ion will generally be stripped of more electrons than one precipitating with less energy.
By knowledge of the stripping and charge transfer cross-sections, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium fractions of each charge state versus the ion energy.
This is done using transition probabilities, $P_{ij}$:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_{q}^{i}(E) P^i_{q,q+1}=\phi_{q+1}^{i}(E) P^i_{q+1,q}
    \label{eqn:EqProb}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_q^i$ is the fraction of ions in charge state $q$, at energy $E$, and species $i$, either oxygen or sulfur.
$P^i_{q,q+1}$ denotes the sum of the stripping cross-sections and $P^i_{q+1,q}$, the sum of the charge transfer cross-sections, for species $i$.
A normalization is given by the condition
\begin{equation}
    \int\displaylimits_{0}^{E_0}\sum_{q=q_0}^{q=Z}\phi^i_q(E)dE=1
    \label{eqn:EqProbNorm}
\end{equation}
where $q_0$ denotes the lowest charge state for species $i$, $q_0$=-1 for O and $q_0$=0 for S, $Z$=8,16 are the nuclear charges for O and S, and $\phi_q^i$ is the charge state fraction.
These are shown for oxygen and sulfur as a function of energy in Figures \ref{fig:CSDoxy} and \ref{fig:CSDsul}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/CSDoxy.eps}
    \caption{Oxygen charge state distribution}
    \label{fig:CSDoxy}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/CSDsul.eps}
    \caption{Sulfur charge state distribution}
    \label{fig:CSDsul}
\end{figure}

The charge state equilibrium fractions demonstrate at what energy the ion will reach a given charge state regardless of the collision processes undergone or the initial ion energy; the ion history is immediately forgotten.
From here, one can see, at a glance, what energies are required for an ion to begin producing X-rays.
For both oxygen and sulfur the sixth charge state must be reached to begin producing X-rays (O$^{6+}$ and S$^{6+}$ with projectile excitation, or O$^{7+}$ and S$^{7+}$ with charge exchange).
These charge states are sufficiently reached for both species at an energy between 200-300 keV/u, where they become the most probable charge state for the given energy (a total energy of ~3.2 MeV and ~6.4 MeV for oxygen and sulfur, respectively).
These newly developed equilibrium fractions are no longer in agreement with previous models presented by \citet{ozak2010} and \citet{houston2018}, where they showed an O$^{6+}$ peak at nearly 1 MeV/u and an S$^{6+}$ peak at 600 keV/u.

Not only does it now require less energy to produce charge states capable of emitting X-rays, but the ions are not penetrating the atmosphere as deeply as was previously modeled because more energy is being lost in the middle energy range\footnote{See the stopping power discussion given by \citet{schultz2018}}, affecting the depth effects and predicted X-ray spectra.

\subsection{Depth Effects}

The opacity of the Jovian atmosphere is incorporated into the model using the optical depth of outgoing X-ray photons.
We look at three different path angles, 0$^{\circ}$, 80$^{\circ}$, and 90$^{\circ}$ (where the angle is measured with respect to the axis of rotation), and with two atmospheric profiles; the density profile shown in Figure \ref{fig:atm} and a well-mixed atmosphere as discussed in Section \ref{sec:atm}.
The optical depth is given by
\begin{equation}
    \tau(\lambda,z_{0})=Ch(\theta,z_{0})\sum_{j}\sigma_{j}^{abs}(\lambda)\int\displaylimits_{z_{0}}^{\infty}n_{j}(z)dz
    \label{eqn:tau}
\end{equation}
where $\tau(\lambda,z_{0})$ is the optical depth as a function of emitted photon wavelength, $\lambda$, and the altitude at which the emission occurred, $z_{0}$.
$Ch(\theta,z_{0})$ is the Chapman function, dependent upon the photon path angle, $\theta$, and the altitude.
$\sigma_j^{abs}(\lambda)$ is the absorption cross-section summed over each species, $j$ (H$_2$, He, and CH$_4$), and is a function of wavelength.
$n_j(z)$ is the neutral density of each atmospheric constituent as a function of altitude, integrated from the point of emission out through the top of the atmosphere.

The Chapman function has been approximated to $Ch(0^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 80^{\circ},z_{0}) \approx \mathrm{sec}(\theta)$ for the first two exit angles and
\begin{equation}
    Ch(\frac{\pi}{2},z_{0})=\sqrt{\frac{R_J}{H(z_0)}\frac{\pi}{2}}
    \label{eqn:Chap}
\end{equation}
for $\theta$=90$^{0}$, where $R_J$ is the Jovian radii of 71,492 km and $H(z_0)$ is the scale height at altitude $z_0$.
The spectrum intensity, $I(\lambda)$ can then be calculated as
\begin{equation}
    4\pi I(\lambda)=\int\displaylimits_{z_0}^{\infty}P(\lambda,z)e^{-\tau(\lambda,z_0)}dz
    \label{eqn:I}
\end{equation}
where $P(\lambda,z)$ is the production rate of X-ray emission as a function of wavelength, $\lambda$ and altitude, $z$.
$z_0$ is the deepest altitude that is reached by the ion beam before all of its energy is deposited into the atmosphere.
$P(\lambda,z)$ integrated over every value of $\lambda$ is equal to the ion production rate, $P(z)$, for a given charge state.
Therefore, to determine the production rate as a function of wavelength there are a couple of things to note before building synthetic spectra.

\subsection{Synthetic X-ray Spectra}
\label{sec:XraySpec}

An X-ray can be emitted through either the ion gaining an electron (what we refer to as charge transfer or charge exchange collisions) or the excitation of the ion (called direct excitation).
Both of these scenarios can result with an electron in an excited state where it will emit photons as it cascades down to a more energy favorable state.
Although we have many charge transfer and projectile excitation processes we only allow three of each type to ultimately result in the emission of a photon, TI, SC, and SC+SS for charge exchange and SI+SPEX, DI+SPEX, and TEX+SPEX for direct excitation.
Any collision that results in more than one electron being in an excited state at any time, whether it be through charge exchange, projectile excitation, or a combination of the two (e.g. DC or SC+SPEX collisions), we consider it much more likely for the Auger effect to take place than the emission of a photon.

\citet{hui2010} created synthetic, charge exchange, X-ray emission lines for photon energies above 200 eV for O$^{6+}$ and O$^{7+}$ with initial ion energies of 1.2 MeV/u and 2.0 MeV/u, and S$^{8+}$-S$^{14+}$ at 1.86 MeV/u.
Although these energies are slightly higher than what we expect to be precipitating, these emission lines are the most comprehensive set available, thus we have taken the 1.2 MeV/u emission lines for oxygen and 1.86 MeV/u lines for sulfur and integrated them into our model.
(Note: S$^{6+}$, S$^{7+}$, and S$^{15+}$ are not included in this study because \citet{hui2010} did not include them in their data, although they are X-ray producing charge states.)
\citet{hui2010} were able to produce spectra vs. number of photons/ion which we have re-normalized for each charge state to total number of photons/charge state.
We then multiplied the ion production from charge exchange produced by our model, $P(z)$, by the normalized emission lines to generate $P(\lambda,z)$.

Unfortunately, we do not have any state-selective excitation emission spectra of oxygen and sulfur; instead we need to apply an approximation to the charge exchange emission lines we do have available.
Because charge transfer collisions are pulling an electron into the particle from outside of the ionization potential the electron will cascade from very high energy states until it has energetically relaxed.
This allows for high energy X-rays to be emitted and also many cascading possibilities.
However, direct excitation excites an electron from the highest occupied electronic energy level, likely resulting in a change in principal quantum number of only one or two.
Once the electron is in a particular energy level it is unaware of whether it has been excited or picked up from outside of the ion; thus, at that point, the cascading probabilities should not differ between charge exchange or excitation.
That is to say, electrons relaxing from charge transfer collisions will always be capable of following the same cascade path as an electron excited by direct excitation, but the reverse is not true.
Excited electrons will not start at principal quantum number $n=\infty$, like charge transferred electrons.
So an approximation to represent the higher probability of electrons starting at lower principal quantum numbers, rather than coming from $n=\infty$ is needed.
(Note: A second thing to consider would be forbidden excitation transitions for each charge state; however, that requires a much more in-depth study of the situation that we do not include in our approximation.)

We first approximate O$^{7+}$ as H, O$^{^6+}$ and S$^{14+}$ as He, S$^{13+}$ as Li, S$^{12+}$ as Li$^{+}$ or Be, S$^{11+}$ as Be$^{+}$, S$^{10+}$ as Be$^{++}$, and S$^{9+}$ as Be$^{3+}$, and assume the rest of the sulfur charge states will follow the same pattern shown by the higher charge states.
We then reviewed a number of articles concerning electron-impact excitation of lithium \citep{griffin2001}, beryllium \citep{bartschat1996}, lithium-like \citep{bely1966}, and beryllium-like \citep{bartschat1996} particles to understand the relative cross-sections between excitation to various electronic energy levels.
The cross-sections for all of these cases were dominated by a change in principal quantum number of one, i.e. when an electron is excited it will typically ($\sim$80$\%$-85$\%$ of the time) only be excited to the next highest energy level.
Occasionally, $\sim$15$\%$-20$\%$  of the time, it will be excited to an even higher energy state.

Therefore, we take the two or three most common emission lines, at lower photon energies, from the charge exchange synthetic spectra provided by \citet{hui2010} and distribute the direct excitation emission in the following way
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{2,3}\lambda_{i}f_{i}=E
    \label{eqn:DEemission}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{i}$ is the wavelength of the most likely emission line, or group of emission lines.
If there is a group of emission lines with similar wavelengths ($\Delta\lambda\approx$ 10 eV), the emission is distributed evenly among each wavelength because in this simple approximation we do not know the exact state-selective excitation transitions, and forbidden excitation states have not been considered.
$f_{i}$ is the distribution of X-ray production given to each wavelength.
If only two lines, or groups of lines, are considered then $f_{1}$=0.85 and $f_{2}$=0.15; for three, $f_{1}$=0.80, $f_{2}$=0.15, and $f_{3}$=0.05.
$E$ is the total photon energy from emission.

To ensure this approximation is not violating conservation of energy, if $E>\Delta E$, where $\Delta E$ is the energy loss for SPEX at a given ion energy and charge state shown in \citet{schultz2018}, then the emission given in Equation \ref{eqn:DEemission} is re-normalized to conserve energy,
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n=1}^{2,3}\lambda_{n}f_{n}\epsilon=E
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon=\Delta E/E$.
If $E<\Delta E$ then we keep the distribution as is and assume the energy difference is due to emission from lower energy photons not considered in the X-ray spectrum and X-ray inefficiencies in emission from the way the electrons cascade through the electron orbitals.

To produce a more realistic observation, than perfect line emission, that an X-ray observatory would detect, we apply a normalized Gaussian distribution to each data point to simulate instrumental response functions, recovering a new intensity:
\begin{equation}
    4\pi I'(\lambda)=\sum_{\lambda_{\mu}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}I(\lambda)e^{-\frac{(\lambda-\lambda_{\mu})^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is now the full spectrum (in eV) which we allow to go from 100 eV to 3500 eV. $\lambda_{\mu}$ is the original wavelength data points, $\sigma^2$ is the variance which we have set to 20 eV.

\subsection{Juno Data}

With recent measurements from the JEDI instrument \citep{mauk2017ssr} on the Juno spacecraft, we have been able to obtain heavy ion flux measurements above Jupiter's polar caps indicating both oxygen and sulfur precipitation \citep{haggerty2017,clark2017a,clark2017b}.
We are able to input these measurements into our model to produce expected observables for a given flux.
For the most recent modeling, we use heavy ion measurements from a northern auroral pass during Perijove 7 on July 11, 2017 displayed in Figure \ref{fig:JEDIFlux}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/O+S_PJ7.eps}
    \caption{Oxygen and sulfur flux measurements from JEDI on the Juno spacecraft during Perijove 7 that were used as an input to our model.}
    \label{fig:JEDIFlux}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that to make the flux usable to our model, we first extrapolate the sulfur data points to lower energies and interpolate all of the data, then re-normalize the measurements to counts/cm$^2$/s.
The extrapolation we apply to the sulfur data was only done for energies between 5-19 keV/u, well below the X-ray producing range, and was simply extrapolated to have the same shape of distribution oxygen had at those energies.
Also, the first three energy bins (170.7, 240.2, and 323.6 keV) on the JEDI instrument is unable to distinguish between oxygen and sulfur.
To account for that we assume a distribution of 2/3 oxygen and 1/3 sulfur, because the heavy ions likely originate from the sulfur dioxide, SO$_2$, volcanoes on IO.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Ion Production Rates}

When referring to ion production rates, it is important to note that we are only referencing production from charge transfer collisions, i.e. $X^q \rightarrow X^{q-1}$, because that is what produces photon emission.
Therefore, the ion production rate as a function of altitude, $P(z)$, can be calculated outright for a product ion species, $i$, (e.g. O$^{7+}$ or S$^{8+}$) as follows:
\begin{equation}
    P(z)=\int\displaylimits_{z_0}^{\infty}n(z)[\sigma_{q,q-1}^i(E(z))]\phi_q^i\Phi^idz
\end{equation}
where $n(z)$ is the neutral atmosphere density of H$_2$, $\sigma_{q,q-1}^i(E(z))$ denotes the charge transfer cross-sections for species $i$ with energy $E$ at altitude $z$, $\phi_q^i$ is the equilibrium fraction given in Equations \ref{eqn:EqProb} and \ref{eqn:EqProbNorm}, and $\Phi^i$ represents the total flux of the initial ion beam.
However, our model uses a Monte Carlo method that tracks each ion individually and counts each charge exchange collision that occurs for a given charge state.
These collisions are tracked through a set of altitude bins with a given input of $\sim$20,000 incident ions and then the production rate is normalized to an input of 1 ion/cm$^2$/s.
The production rates as a function of H$_2$ density and altitude for O$^{6+}$ and O$^{7+}$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:O6O7+Prod}.
For sulfur, Figure \ref{fig:S7S8+Prod} shows the S$^{7+}$ and S$^{8+}$ charge transfer production rates.
It is to be emphasized, these production rates only include charge exchange from the three collisions discussed in Section \ref{sec:XraySpec}, that is TI, SC, and SC+SS; although other processes can contribute to lowering the overall charge state without emitting a photon (e.g. the Auger process).
The altitude integrated production rates for every charge state and various initial ion energies can be found in Appendices \ref{app:Oxy} and \ref{app:Sul}, including the production rate of directly excited ions.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/O6O7CXProd2x2.eps}
    \caption{The O$^{6+}$ and O$^{7+}$ production rate from TI, SC, and SC+SS vs. H$_2$ density and altitude for various incident ion energies (E=0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 25.0 MeV/u). The production rates have been normalized to a single incident ion/cm$^2$/s.}
    \label{fig:O6O7+Prod}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/S7S8CXProd2x2.eps}
    \caption{The S$^{7+}$ and S$^{8+}$ production rate from TI, SC, and SC+SS vs. H$_2$ density and altitude for various incident ion energies (E=0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 MeV/u). The production rates have been normalized to a single incident ion/cm$^2$/s.}
    \label{fig:S7S8+Prod}
\end{figure}

It is evident that the production rate of X-ray producing charge states from charge exchange collisions, O$^{6+}$ and S$^{7+}$, is obtained with as little as 200 keV/u, which is well within the range of ion energies that have been measured by Juno above the polar caps \citep{haggerty2017,clark2017a,clark2017b}.


\subsection{X-ray Efficiencies}

The emitted photon flux can be determined using the production rates, shown in Figures \ref{fig:O6O7+Prod} and \ref{fig:S7S8+Prod}, and Equation \ref{eqn:I}, where $4\pi$ is included to convert the intensity units from cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ to cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.
An X-ray emission efficiency is a way of quantifying how many photons are emitted given an incident ion energy and is found by dividing $4\pi I$ by the initial energy of the monoenergetic ion beam.
Table \ref{tab:XrayEff} shows the X-ray efficiency from both charge exchange and direct excitation emission combined for a few data points at various viewing angles using both atmosphere 1 and 2.
The full set of efficiencies for every X-ray emitting charge state at each energy and three different viewing angles plus a no opacity case can be found in Appendices \ref{app:Oxy} and \ref{app:Sul}.

The efficiency shown here includes X-ray production from both charge exchange and direct excitation collisions.}
    \label{tab:XrayEff}
\end{table}

The most efficient X-ray emission for O$^{6+}$, S$^{8+}$, and S$^{9+}$ is with an incident ion energy of 500 keV/u for both atmospheres and 1 MeV/u for O$^{7+}$.
The well-mixed atmosphere has minimal effects on emission from low energy ion precipitation because the ions are not precipitating deep enough for the large column density to have much of an impact on the X-rays.
As one would expect, the viewing angle of 90$^{\circ}$ greatly reduces emission for high energy ion precipitation when comparing with X-rays that propagate directly up and out of the atmosphere at 0$^{\circ}$, due to the reduced opacity effects experienced by the photons.
This is even more true for X-ray production from sulfur which is the most efficient X-ray producer (i.e. S$^{8+}$) at 500 keV/u with a viewing angle of 0$^{\circ}$, but the efficiency is reduced by nearly 60$\%$ (for atmosphere 1) when the viewing angle changes to 90$^{\circ}$, whereas O$^{6+}$ is only reduced by about 12$\%$ (for atmosphere 1) making it the most efficient for 500 keV/u at 90$^{\circ}$.
This is a very important effect to consider when looking at fluxes from earth based X-ray observations, which are generally taken at a very steep viewing angle.

\citet{ozak2010} reported the most efficient X-ray emission for O$^{6+}$, O$^{7+}$, and S$^{8+}$ occurring for incident ions with energies of 1.5 MeV/u, 2.5 MeV/u, and 1 MeV/u, and efficiency values of $\sim$0.009, $\sim$0.003, and $\sim$0.015, respectively.
These energies are 2-3x higher than what we are now producing with the SIM cross-sections.
There are two major contributions accounting for such a great difference in X-ray efficiencies.
Firstly, it requires much less energy to strip both oxygen and sulfur ions to a high, X-ray producing, charge state, allowing X-rays to be created at a much lower energy than previously thought.
Secondly, we are depositing much more energy higher up in the atmosphere due to the increase in stopping power shown by \citet{schultz2018}, ultimately generating X-rays higher in the atmosphere than previously modeled, making them less susceptible to opacity effects even when considering an upper-limit atmosphere.

\subsection{X-ray Spectra}

When producing a synthetic X-ray spectrum we are able to distinguish between charge states and production type (charge transfer or direct excitation) and consider the effects due to opacity at different viewing angles in atmospheres 1 and 2.
Figure \ref{fig:XraySpec} shows the total X-ray emission for a single oxygen plus a single sulfur ion (sulfur to oxygen ratio of 1:1), both with incident energies of 500 keV/u.
The emission lines have been distributed with a normalized Gaussian and $\sigma$=20 eV, simulating instrument response functions (discussed in Section \ref{sec:XraySpec}).
We have split the emission up by charge state to show where in the spectrum each emission line contributes the most, i.e. sulfur dominates at photon energies between 150-500 eV, while oxygen is prominent between 500-900 eV.
This particular spectrum accounts for no opacity effects and we have included emission from both charge exchange and direct excitation collisions.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/O+S_CX+DE_500keVNoOpacSpec.eps}
    \caption{Synthetic X-ray spectra showing the contribution from each charge state. This spectra includes emission from both charge exchange and direct excitation collisions considering no opacity effects from an incident ion beam of 500 keV/u. Not shown is the emission from S$^{14+}$ which peaks at $\sim$2450 eV with an intensity several orders of magnitude lower than the more prominent emission.}
    \label{fig:XraySpec}
\end{figure}

Next, shown in Figure \ref{fig:XraySpecOpac} is the same total emission from Figure \ref{fig:XraySpec} (black line) with opacity effects applied from both atmosphere 1 and 2 at three different viewing angles.
It is apparent that X-ray emission from sulfur is much more effected by opacity than that from oxygen, which was indicated by the X-ray efficiencies in Table \ref{tab:XrayEff}.
This is due to the relatively large photo-absorption cross-sections at longer wavelengths, shown by \citet{cravens2006}.
It's also important to note how little the overall absorption of X-rays is at this energy, even for atmosphere 2.
500 keV/u (a total energy of 8 MeV for oxygen and 16 Mev for sulfur) is slightly below the most energetic ions JEDI is capable of measuring if they are oxygen, and well above the 10 MeV instrument threshold \citep{mauk2017ssr} if they are sulfur.
This indicates that most X-ray emission from ion measurements made by JEDI will escape without undergoing large opacity effects and should be detectable, even if a very well-mixed atmosphere is present.
These results are much different than those presented by \citet{ozak2010}, which show a reduction in sulfur emission by nearly two orders of magnitude when considering a 90$^{\circ}$ viewing angle.

Initial ion energies are 500 keV/u for both oxygen and sulfur precipitation. Photon energies below about 400 eV are shown to be much more affected by the opacity than higher photon energies.}
